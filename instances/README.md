# Instances

These instance sets deal with Vehicle Routing Problems combined with 3D Loading ("3L-CVRP" and "3L-VRPTW").
Also the 2L-CVRP datasets for Pollaris et al. (2016) and Pollaris et al. (2017) are provided.
To ensure the non-stacking, the height of each pallet is equal to the vehicle height.
