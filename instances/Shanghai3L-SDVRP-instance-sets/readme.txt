Additional remarks regarding instance sets for 3L-SDVRP

. It is assumed that a support condition holds where at least 75% of the base of each box must be 
  supported from below by other boxes or the container floor; 
  as far as we know this condition is also met by Ceschia et. al (2013)

. A box is fragile if and only if the fragility flag (also "frag") is set to 1; 
  in this case only (other) fragile boxes can be placed on top of the box.

. The instances by Ceschia et al. (2013) are not offered at this website.
